## Search 
Suppose you have a hash table and you are looking for berger and want to know it price.So you
have been given a key and you want to know the associated value with it.So key is Berger.So
using the HASH Function we get the index of node. We traverse the node and search for the key.
In case if the item is not found then we will return a pointer which will point to NULL.
