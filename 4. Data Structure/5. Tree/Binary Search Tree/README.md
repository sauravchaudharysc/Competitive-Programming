# Binary Search Tree

**Binary Search Tree** is a binary tree with following properties :- 

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

**The above properties of Binary Search Tree provides an ordering among keys so that the operation like searching, finding minimum & maximum can be done fast. Less comparison then binary tree.**

#### Elements can’t repeated in BST.
