<h1 align="center">Tree</h1>

A tree is a connected, acyclic graph that consist of n nodes & n-1 edges. Removing any edge from a tree divides it into two components, and adding any edge to a tree creates a cycle.<br>**Moreover, there is always a unique path between any two nodes of a tree.**

### Tree Terminologies 

**Node :** An entity that contains a value and pointers to itâ€™s child nodes.

**Leaf or External Nodes :** The last nodes of each path or nodes with degree 1.

**Internal Nodes :** The nodes with degree >1 or nodes which has at least 1 child node.

**Edge :** Link between any two node.

**Root :** Top most node of a tree.

**Parent :**  Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent node.

**Child :**  The node below an given node connected by its edge downward is called child node.

**Levels :**  Represent the generation of node. Root node is at level 0.

**Height of a tree :** Number of edge from the root node to the deepest leaf( i.e. longest path from the root node to leaf node.)

**Degree of node :** It is the total no of nodes connected to a node or the no of edge that node has.

#### Why Trees ?

1. Router Algorithms
2. Multi-Stage Decision Making
3. Information easy to search
4. Store information that naturally forms a hierarchy

## Tree Traversal

A Tree is traversed in two ways : 

1. BFS or Level Order Traversal 

2. DFS

   - Preorder (Root-Left-Right)
   - Inorder (Left-Root-Right)
   - Postorder (Left-Right-Root)
