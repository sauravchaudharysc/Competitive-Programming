<h1 align="center">Directed Graphs</h1>

Here we will discuss two classes of directed graphs : 

 - **Acyclic Graphs**

   The graph where no cycle exist,so there is no path from any node to itself.

 - **Successor Graphs**

   The outdegree of each node is 1, so each node has a unique successor.

In both cases, we can design efficient algorithm that are based on the special properties of the graphs.
