## Cycle 

A path that starts from a given vertex and ends at the same vertex is called a **cycle**.

### Detect a Cycle 

- **[Directed Graph :](Directed%20Graph)** Directed graphs have edges that have a direction.
- **[Undirected Graph :](UnDirected%20Graph)** Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction.
